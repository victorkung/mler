							<h4 id= "program-details">THE PROGRAM</h4>
							<p class="first-p">Our flagship program is the Bar Process Management Program. Our Program is offered twice a year, January and May, in preparation for the Illinois Bar Exams conducted in February and July, respectively. Each Program session lasts approximately six weeks and consists of small group meetings and large group lectures. Every week students are given a practice exam which includes both essay and Multistate Bar Exam questions. Generally, three licensed attorneys tutor each small group and, on a weekly basis, the tutors grade and provide personalized feedback on each student’ s practice essay exams. Students who are repeat test-takers are given additional attention through weekly homework assignments which are also evaluated by our tutors. MLER also conducts a DIRAC (Decision, Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) clinic, a Multistate Performance Test clinic, and a full-day simulated Multistate Essay Examination. The Program is distinguished through the dedicated support of our tutors and the invaluable tips and tools we provide on how to balance the stresses during the bar exam preparation period.</p>

							<h5>What We Expect</h5>
							
							<p class="first-p">
								The students of our Bar Exam Preparation Program are provided with a wide range of services to increase their likelihood of success on the bar exam.

								<li>
									<p>Enroll in a commercial bar review course</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Attend MLER every week and take all exams</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Create and follow a study schedule</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Repeater students are encouraged to complete all homework assignments</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Maintain a POSITIVE mental attitude, believing in your success, and making a commitment to become an MLER tutor once you have passed the bar.</p>
